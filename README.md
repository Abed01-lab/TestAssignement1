## Reflection

1. Shooting

The possible reasons for them man not dying:

- The shot missed the man
- The shot hit a non-lethal part of the body like finger/toe
- The man was already dead so he could not die from the bullet
- The man was able to stop the damages and get medical attention
- The man had a bulletproof vest on
- The man had a heavy school bag on and was facing away from the bullet. The bullet hit his computer inside the bag
- The gun was a paintball gun
- The woman shot the gun from underwater which slowed down the bullet
- A racoon jumped in front of the man and tanked the shot which slowed down the bullet
- A navy seal was watching the situation and fires his own sniper to miraculously hit the bullet mid-air to split it in 2
- fast

   List the steps it takes to brush teeth for the alien to understand:

- Grab the toothbrush with your right hand
- Hold the toothbrush with the brush facing up
- Grab the toothpaste container with your left hand
- Hold the toothpaste container without squeezing it.
- Use your left thumb and pointy finger to rotate the cap of the toothpaste container anti-clockwise until it detaches from the container
- Hover the opening of your toothpaste container above the brush of the toothbrush.
- Squeeze the toothpaste container gently until the toothbrush is covered with toothpaste
- Pick up the toothpaste cap with your left hand and rotate it clockwise on top of the toothpaste container.
- Put the toothpaste back where you picked it up
- Rotate the water fountain opener anti clockwise with your left hand
- Hover your toothbrush below the water for 1 second
- Rotate the water fountain opener clockwise with your left hand
- Hold the toothbrush so the toothpaste is touching the front of your top-left teeth in your mouth and rub the toothbrush back and forth with moderate force for 3 seconds.
